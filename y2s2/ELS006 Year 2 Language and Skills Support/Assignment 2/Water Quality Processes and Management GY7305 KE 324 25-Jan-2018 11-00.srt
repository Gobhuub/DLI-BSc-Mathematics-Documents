0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
他 呃 去
He's, um, go along to

1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,940
不 不是3 3 5 6 是3 4 3 5
No, not three, three, five, six, it's, uh, three, four, three, five.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,630
你们将要看到的
That's the one you will see.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,410
关于黑板网站的安排 我还需要做一些零零碎碎的工作
I still need to do one or two bits and pieces with the arrangement of the blackboard site.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,890
但是在左手边你会看到菠萝的视频
But on the left hand side you'll see pineappdo video.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,270
如果你点击它 甚至双击它 就会发生一些事情
And if you click on that, or even double click on it, something should happen.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:40,210
里有很多我去年讲过的课程的链接 和我今年要讲的课程差不多
You'll see that there's a whole range of um links there to lectures that I gave last year in this module, which are pretty much the same as the lectures I'm going to give this year.

7
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:49,420
当我告诉你们的时候 我会给你们发邮件去买一块黑板来准备下一节课
And when I tell you, I'll email you all buy a blackboard to prepare for the next lecture.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,370
希望你们能在黑板上看到下一讲的内容
Hopefully you can go on to onto blackboard and, um, and see what the next lectured about.

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:10,630
我会告诉你们 如果我想让你们在上课前看一下全景视频 样我们就可以在上课时进行更多的互动讨论
And and I'll give you, I'll give you heads up if I'm if I want you to look at the panoplue video before the lecture, and so that we can actually have some more interactive discussion during the lecture.

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,090
 我会通过电子邮件告诉你
Then then I'll, I'll let you know by email.

11
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:47,840
好的 如果你点击其中 如果你点击 你会得到样你就有机会了 对吧
Okay, hopefully, if you click on one of these, so if you click on that one, you get the so that you can have a chance, right?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,090
我就不给你们看了 但希望你们能理解我要说的
So I won't show you that, but you can hopefully understand what I have to say.

13
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,990
看一遍幻灯片 希望大家都能看清楚
Go through the slides, and hopefully it all will be clear.

14
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,840
如果你因为任何原因不能看些视频 请告诉我
If you can't, for any reason see those videos, then let me know.

15
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:20,720
今天的课程是本模块的第一讲 我们将详细讨论特定过程中特定类型的污染
Okay, so today's lecture is the 1st proper lecture of the module, where we're actually gonna talk in detail about particular type of pollution of particular set of processes.

16
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,900
我们将从点源污染开始 点源控制水质
And we're going to start point source pollution, so point source controls over water quality.

17
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,860
我要做的是给大家简单介绍一下点源污染
What I'm going to do is give you a brief introduction to point source pollution.

18
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:44,660
周二的时候我已经讲过了 但我还是要再讲一遍以防周二没来的同学 只是讲一下点源区域的阈值内存
I kind of did that already on Tuesday, but I'll just go over that again in case there are people here who weren't here on Tuesday, just to a threshold memory about what we mean by point source region.

19
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:59,290
我将花一些时间来谈论污水处理 因为在英国最重要的污染源来自于下水道网络 它通常通过污水处理厂处理废水
I will spend some time talking about sewage treatment, because the most important point sources of pollution in the UK come from the Sewer network, which usually feeds through a sewage treatment works and treats the wastewater.

20
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:09,970
我将讨论B-O-D和溶解在污水中的医生的动态
Then I'll talk about the dynamics of B-O-D and dissolved doctors in flowing waters receiving sewage.

21
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:19,130
它们包括理解些概念 混合 方程 动力学建模 以及薄膜污染
And they involve understanding those concepts, so the mixing, equation, modeling of those dynamics, and film pollution.

22
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,490
但我今天不会讲些
But I won't talk about those today.

23
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:33,820
我想今天我只讲前三种 介绍主题 谈谈食物治疗 广义地讲一下预兆动力学的概念
I think today I'll just talk about the top three, introduce the topic, talk about food treatment, and then talk broadly about the concept of bode do dynamics.

24
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,860
周二我会更详细地讲
I will go in a more detail on Tuesday about that.

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,420
是周二课上关于点源的例子
So examples from tuesday's lecture on point sources.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,100
认真的治疗工作 很大的 非常重要的点源
Serious treatment works, a big, really important point source.

27
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,560
全国各地 有成百上千个污水处理厂 如果没有上千个 污水处理厂就有上千个
All over the country, there are hundreds and hundreds of sewage treatment works, if not thousands, of sewage treatment works.

28
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,100
你的污水都被处理了
So all over lesser your your sewage is treated.

29
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:10,250
在莱斯特市 在城市北部的污水处理厂 下游的污水流入了索尔河
In the city of Leicester, at the one look sewage works, which is north of the city, downstream, feeds into the River Sore.

30
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,300
如果你想知道更多关于科诺 去了解或土地污水处理厂的位置和影响
If you want to know more about that Conono, go about locations and impact of orland sewage works.

31
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,480
但如果你住在
But if you lived in E.G.

32
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,740
市场港 你会在马克港有污水处理厂
Market Harbor, you would have a sewage works in Marker Harbor.

33
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,000
如果你住在喜旺和小山上 你就会在小山上有污水处理厂
If you lived in Hopes and on the Hill, you would have a sewage works and holding on the hill.

34
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,660
你可以在普通的地图上看到 它们实际上是显示出来的 它会说 污水处理厂 或污水处理厂
And you can often sees on an ordinary survey map, they're actually shown, and it might actually say, sewage treatment works, or sewage works.

35
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:42,760
好的  我今天会多谈谈些污水处理厂的处理方法
Okay, um. I will talk more about the processes that operate in those sewage treatment works today.

36
00:04:43,720 --> 00:05:00,060
工业也是潜在的点源 想象工厂在生产一些涉及到水处理的东西 你必须冲洗或以某种方式使用水 通常有废物从过程中
Industry is also a potential point source of Imagine a factory that's producing something involving some sort of aquious process, where you have to wash down or use water in some way, there's usually a waste product from that process.

37
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,480
你知道 很多食品加工都需要水 即使只是为了冲洗地球等等
And a lot of food processing requires water, you know, even if it's just for washing down the planet, etc.

38
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,340
水会被污染
And that water may be contaminated.

39
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:18,500
如果是食品加工 它会被有机方法污染 你知道 从机器之类的东西
If it's food processing, it will be contaminated with organic method from from the, you know, pleading down machines and that kind of thing.

40
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:27,460
因此 工业经常通过管道将被污染的水排放到地表水中
So industry often discharge polluted water through a pipe and into a surface water.

41
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:43,620
最后 我们谈到了发电站 我们在周二的时候谈到过 我们会在周二的时候 讨论更多关于野生动物污染的概念
And then finally, we've got power stations, which we talked about on um Tuesday, and we'll talk more about when we, when we revisit the concept of fermal pollution on on Tuesday.

42
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:56,660
每都通过点源病毒管道向地表水中排放污染物
And each one of these is emitting a pollutant into a surface water via a point source viral pipe, essentially.

43
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:13,350
我们所说的点源污染指的是污染进入隐蔽的 可识别的地方 而进入地方的污染源是可识别的
And that's really what we mean by point source pollution is pollution is entering at a discreet, identifiable place, and the source for the pollution that comes in to to that is identifyable.

44
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:25,310
我们知道污水处理厂通过下水道网络收集来自整个莱斯特和南部的污水
We we understand that at one lit the sewage works is collecting sewage through the sewer network from the whole of Leicester and south by seven throat water can actually define.

45
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,460
你听说过行尸房 好吗
You've probably heard of the walker shed, okay?

46
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,420
在浪费处理中 人们经常谈到污水棚
In wasteful treatment, they often talk about the sewer shed.

47
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,970
因此 下水道棚是确定的 流出的水将确切地知道他们的集水区在哪里
So the sewer shed is definable that ungoing water will know exactly where their catchment is.

48
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:50,830
比如 污水处理厂 其他的都是一样的 他们需要知道些 以便能够规划 实际进入工厂的污水量
For one look, sewage works, and the same for all of their other They need to know that in order to be able to plan the volumes of sewage that will actually enter the enter the plant.

49
00:06:51,590 --> 00:07:00,680
出于兴趣 我将在以后的课程中重温些内容 但在本模块结束时 你们应该非常清楚些内容
Now, just just out of interest, I'll come I will revisit this later in the course, but you should really know this very, very well by the end of the module.

50
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:09,360
我们一般每人一天要用多少水
What volume of water do we typically use per per person in a day?

51
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,160
你觉得我们用了多少
How much do you think we use?

52
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,900
恐龙吗 我们先来讨论一下一天中我们用了多少水
Dinosaur? I think start us off discussing the how many, how many later the water we use in the day.

53
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,090
良好的气体角 是合理的量
Good gas Cape. So this is a reasonable amount.

54
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,930
我是说 你又没喝那么多
I mean, you don't really drink that much.

55
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,950
让你喝了几升
You've made to drink a couple of liters.

56
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,050
你会用一些来做饭
You might use some for cooking.

57
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,900
你可以洗个澡 保释 洗衣服 洗碗
You might take a shower, bail, laundry, dishwashing, maybe.

58
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,280
 50 好吧 我觉得数字很合理
Um, so 50. Okay, I-I think that's a sensible number.

59
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,680
有人提前告诉我了吗
Anybody got me advance on that?

60
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,200
我迷上了巴菲 好吧 是的
I am all over Buffy. Okay, yeah.

61
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,870
你打算升到多高
How high are you going to go?

62
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,550
谢谢你 五个好吧 有人想再高一点吗
Thank you. Five. Okay. Anybody want to go higher?

63
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,670
不 实际上是150升
No, it's actually about 150 liters.

64
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:23,940
听起来很高 但实际上 如果你去北美 美国和加拿大 他们每人每天用400公升
OK It sounds high, but actually, if you go to North America, U-S and Canada, they use maybe 400 every person every day, using 400 liters.

65
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,500
那是很多水 里 大约是150
That's a lot of water. Here, it's about about 150.

66
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:36,840
我是水控 我有时会看我的水费账单 它是在水表上的 我可以看看多少钱
I being a water geek, I sometimes look at my water bill and it I'm on a meter, so I can look at how much.

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,690
它告诉我在一段时间内我用水的体积
They tell me the volume of water I've used in a particular period of time.

68
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,010
我算出来了  差不多了
And I work it out. And, um, it's about right.

69
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,770
我家住的都是穷人 我们每天用600片叶子
Just poor people live in my household, and we we use, um, probably about 600 leaves a day.

70
00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:00,390
现在少了一些 但是  是的 是 是数字
Um, bit bit less these days, but, um, yeah, it's, it's, that's about, that's about the number.

71
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:07,740
有相当多的水进入了房子 些水 几乎所有的水都以污水的形式离开了房子
So it's quite a lot of water coming into the house, and that water, pretty much all of it leave the house in the sewage.

72
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:21,550
好的 它基本上是分开使用的 你知道 几乎所有的东西 你不会流汗到大气中 或者你用在你的花园或洗车实际上没有排放下来
Okay, so it's basically used apart, you know, anything, pretty much anything that you don't sweat out into the atmosphere, or that maybe you use toward your garden or washing car there isn't actually discharged down.

73
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,910
排水管实际上被推了出来
The drain is actually pushed back out.

74
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:43,080
水公司将在莱斯特七踩水 将150年 或多或少 人均每天150升 加上所有的水从道路径流 你有是 记住 我们有很多结合下水道 把所有的道路径流
So the water company will be seven tread water in in Lester, will treat 150, more or less, 150 liters per capita per day, plus all the water that you got from the road runoff, is that, remember, we got a lot combined sewers, and that's taking all that road runoff.

75
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,870
实际的输入 如果你有下水道 假设有5万人
So the actual input, if you've got A-A sewer shed that contains, let's say, 50000 people.

76
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:59,030
为了计算每天流入的水量 你必须将50000人乘以150升
In order to to calculate the volume of water coming in per day, you'd have to multiply those 50000 people by 150 liters.

77
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:13,840
你还得加上从罗登诺夫进口的多余的水 更重要的是 些额外的输入来自边境公司所谓的 贸易富裕
And then you'd have to add on all of the extra water that comes in from Rodenoff, and importantly, the extra inputs from what the border companies call trade affluent.

78
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,470
好吗 我们把它写下来 因为它是所有些
OK? We write it down, because it's all of these

79
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:29,120
概念 比如贸易富裕的概念 是你们在环境管理行业中遇到的概念
concepts, things like the concept of trade affluent, are concepts that you meet in the environmental management industry.

80
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:37,360
你知道 他们基本上都是全球性的公司 环境署和所有的顾问都是围绕着问题
You know, they are basically world companies, and the Environment Agency and all of the consultants that go around that.

81
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:56,450
的一件事 我想让你出去 如果你有兴趣 其中一件事我想让你走出模块是假设或吸收词汇会让你在2因为有工作在一领域工作 我觉得些很有趣的工作
And one of the things that I want you to get out, if you're interested, one of the things I'd like you to get out of this module is to is to assume or assimilate a vocabulary that will allow you to work in this 2nd Because there are jobs in this sector, and I think being able to these are quite interesting jobs.

82
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,350
它们与你正在做的事情相关
They're relevant to what you're doing.

83
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,230
有些地理学家得到了些工作
And there are geographers who get these jobs.

84
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,750
好吧 他们的工作 他们在咨询公司工作
Okay? They work. They get jobs in consultncies.

85
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,690
他们在环境署工作
They get jobs for the Environment Agency.

86
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,070
请让他们为水找工作
They get jobs for water, please.

87
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,450
好吧 做种事的毕业生
Okay? Graduate jobs doing this kind of thing.

88
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,920
当你学习的时候 你必须吸收词汇 当你谈论托盘的时候
And you've got to assimilate the vocabulary when you go for it, as you you can talk about tray.

89
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,000
你说话的时候就会流口水
Effluid just, it'll just roll off you talk.

90
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,460
以及可持续的城市出行系统
And talk about sustainable urban journey system.

91
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,450
滚下去 你说 我想让你们得到的
Roll off, you talk. So that's kind of what I want you to get.

92
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:34,900
我想让你试试 我想强调一下词汇 我希望你们在考试和作业中使用些词汇
I want you to try. And I want to sort of emphasize the vocabulary, and I'd like you to use the vocabulary in the exam and in the in the assignment.

93
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,060
是相关的 好吧 我们当然可以喝烈酒
It is relevant. Okay, um, of course we can have accidental spirit.

94
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:50,670
想象一下 大仓库 把农药装在桶里放在院子里 他们着火了 些桶破裂了
So imagine a, um, a big warehouse that keeps um pesticides in drums on a courtyard or whatever, and they get a fire, and those drums rupture.

95
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,680
你可以 你可以把一些污染物输入到水中
Then you can, you can get some inputs of that pollutant into into the water.

96
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,000
是离散的点源
So that could be, it's a discrete point source.

97
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,060
是另点源的例子
So that's another example of a point source.

98
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:13,610
我们实际上讨论了农业中的资源 从动物粪便的容器 动物的废物 或绵羊的浸液 诸如此类的东西
And then we actually talked about resources in agriculture, from containment of of animal slurry, waste waste material from animals, or from sheep dip and that kind of thing.

99
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:22,270
但最重要的 我说的是开始 是在英国的治疗努力
But the most important one, which I said is the beginning, is is treated efforts in the UK.

100
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,900
它实际上是来自污水处理厂的水
It's actually the the water coming out of of wastewater treatment plants.

101
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,950
好吧 那实际上是基比特和污水处理厂
Okay, that's actually Kibit and sewage works.

102
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,950
德文郡人 不 那是我做的采样
English From devon here. No, that's me something um Sampling.

103
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,730
胆小和苏 我们昨天讨论了不同的节目
Timid and Sue, we talked about separate shows yesterday.

104
00:12:44,010 --> 00:13:06,370
因此 独立的下水道是一种点源 可以把它看作是一种点源 但是在模块中 我将把它们看作是城市的扩散源 因为独立的下水道网络不是很广泛
So separate sewers are kind of a point source that air a pipe that comes out, and they, um, they can be regarded as a point source, but I am going to regard them in this module as an urban diffuse source, because the separate sewer network isn't very extensive.

105
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:19,200
通常 独立的下水道系统只会排水 比如说 住宅区 它会通过相对较小的管道在一条小溪或河流中排放
Usually, a separate sewer system is only going to drain, let's say, a housing estate, and then it's gonna discharge through a relatively small pipe in a small stream or a or a river.

106
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:30,670
 从道路上流出的径流 进入单独的下水道 会被认为是城市的扩散
So the um, the the runoff that comes off the road, that goes into a separate sewer, will regard that as urban diffuse, sort of.

107
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,590
我们会讲到的 我想在上节课中 我们将讨论城市污染源污染
And we'll meet that. I think in the last lecture, we're going to talk about urban defuse, source pollution.

108
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,370
我们将再次讨论概念
So we'll come up against that concept again.

109
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,290
我们又合并成溢位
And then we got combined to overflows again.

110
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,640
还有点源 我们周二讲过
There are point source, um, we talked about those on Tuesday.

111
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:57,660
它们只是间歇性地发生 希望随着它们的升级 它们会减少
They only happen intermittently, and hopefully they are going to be reduced as they upgrade.

112
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:06,480
当时的西华人基本上还是维多利亚时代的 污水网 污水网结合
The sewart still largely Victorian. Sewage network, sewage network combined.

113
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,900
下水道溢流仍然很常见 但水务公司正逐渐试图减少C-S事件的增加
Sewer overflow still quite common. But water companies are gradually trying to reduce C-S so incidents by increase.

114
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:22,760
他们有很大的风暴箱 可以储存大量的水 样就不需要直接排放了
They've got big storm tanks that actually take large volumes and store them so that they don't need to be discharged directly.

115
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:30,900
真的好了 但是 是 是在面试中与溢出或csos相结合的概念
Really Okay. but again, here's a, here's a concept combines to overflows or csos in an interview.

116
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,560
是有用的概念
Again, you might that might be a useful concept.

117
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,140
你们应该很熟悉结合成一排的概念
You know, you should be familiar with that idea of combined to a row with them.

118
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:54,520
当你走到河边 你会看到一棵树上有很多与种固体有关的污水 主要是卫生纸 湿巾和其他你在污水中发现的东西挂在树上 就像圣诞树
When you go down to the river, you see a tree got lots of sewage related to try this solids, mainly toilet roll and wipes and other things that you might find in sewage hanging off the tree, like a Christmas tree.

119
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:02,120
通常是直接指控的证据 在英国 通常意味着附近有银溢出物
That's usually an evidence of a direct this charge, and in the UK, that usually means there's a combined silver overflow close by.

120
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,130
是直接指控的例子
Here's an example of the direct this charge.

121
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:14,130
未经处理的 当我说到直接收费的时候 我的意思是些污水没有经过研究处理工程
So untreated. When I say when I talk about direct this charge, I mean this is sewage that doesn't go through research treatment works.

122
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,190
些都是下水道
So again, these these are sewered

123
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,720
废水 以便它们被收集
wastewaters, so that they are collected in

124
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,590
下水道网络 也连接建筑物的管道网络
a sewer network, so there is a network of pipes that link up to buildings,

125
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,940
所有的污水都会流下去
and all the sewage goes down.

126
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:49,520
比如米兰的人口 并没有意识到他们实际上并没有在20世纪90年代中期 有一棵污水树 而现在就有一棵 是有大量污水排放的地方
So the the population of Milan, E.G., probably don't really realize that they don't actually go didn't at this time in the mid 1990s, have a sewage tree, where there is one now, and this is one one place where a large volume of sewage is actually being discharged.

127
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:55,330
在干燥的天气下 种排放物的流量是2升每2秒
The dry weather flow for this emission is two liters to per 2nd.

128
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,270
好的 是2000升一千升每立方米
Okay, so that's 2000 liters as a thousand liters in a meter cube.

129
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:06,330
应该是很容易记住的东西
That's again, something that should just be quite an easy thing to sort of remember.

130
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:13,750
每2秒就有2000升 每天 是相当大的水量
And so 2000 liters every 2nd, so every day, that's quite a large volume of water.

131
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:28,300
你看 如果你用胶带把量除以150升 就能算出在干燥的天气里 到底有多少人在排放污水
See, if you tape that volume in a day and divide by 150 liters, and it can work out how many people would be actually discharging sewage, more or less, into that on the dry weather.

132
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:38,680
干旱天气下的水流 是 是一本书 是水资源管理词汇的一部分
So the idea of a dry weather flow, again, that's a, that's a book, that's part of the vocabulary of of of water management.

133
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,890
干燥天气的水流反映了干燥天气下的联合下水道
Dry weather flow is reflect a combined sewer under dry weather.

134
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:54,970
它并没有接收任何来自道路的水 它只是在天气里排出的污浊的污水
So it's not receiving any water from the the roads rid off from the road, it's just the the foul sewic sewage that went in that weather.

135
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:07,430
好吗 是相当重要的排放与landro河的排放相比 它接收废水
OK? And here this is quite a significant discharge compared to the discharge of the of the landro the river that that it receives that wastewater.

136
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,040
样就不会有很大的稀释
So you don't have a huge dilution.

137
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,740
事实上 大多数情况下 种情况肯定少于十分之一
In fact, they have certainly less than one in ten most of the time.

138
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,470
呃 在英国 我们会处理所有些垃圾 对吧
Uh? In the UK, we actually treat all of this waste, OK?

139
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,290
种情况不会像我们看到的那样经常发生
So you won't get this kind of thing happening on a regular basis that we saw.

140
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,190
严肃的治疗从空气中起作用 就像上面的图片
And a serious treatment works from the air, looks like that picture up there.

141
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,130
那是相当大的污水处理厂
That's quite a large sewage works.

142
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:43,380
你们可以看到 污水处理厂的特点是圆形的特点 圆形的水箱
And you can see there are, one of the features of sewage works are the circular features, the circular um tanks.

143
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,580
它们有各种各样的用途
They've served various purposes, and they're all various.

144
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,510
它们不一定都执行相同的功能
These are not all necessarily performing the same function.

145
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:59,760
在左边有一些矩形的容器 它们在做
There are some rectangular tanks over there on the left, they might be doing something.

146
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,260
在上面 你可以看到更多的情况
And then up at the top there, you can see there are some more circumstances.

147
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,640
他们都在做不同的事情 好吧
They're all doing different things. Okay?

148
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:23,560
通常 你会发现 在严肃的工作中 首先 你得到的 和进入工厂的废水 好的 我们要做的是 首先 移除大的材料
And typically what you find in a serious work is that 1st of all you've got and the waste water coming into the plant, OK And what we've got to do 1st of all, is remove the large material.

149
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,260
 废水实际上看起来不像便便
This, the waste water actually doesn't look like poo.

150
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,390
粪便在下水道的运输过程中被分解
The poo gets broken up during the process of transport in Sewer.

151
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,110
但是还有其他固体 你知道 三角叶杨
But there are other solids. You know, cottonwood.

152
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:45,930
你摔倒了吗 小湿巾应该是可塑的 但我不应该是可塑的 因为实际上它们很耐冻
Did you throw down? The little um wet wipes that are supposedly fleshable, but I shouldn't really be cold fleshable, because actually they're quite resistant.

153
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:58,830
不要同意使用避孕套 所有你会在废水中发现的东西
And don't agree condoms, all sorts of things that that you might, that you might find in in um in in in waste water, uh.

154
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:07,150
他们基本上有过程 他们真的过滤掉所有的固体材料
And so they basically have a process where they literally screen out all of this solid material.

155
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,550
它有时被称为筛查
It's, it's sometimes called screening literally.

156
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:29,170
有一种机械过滤水来过滤所有的固体你有过程 主要的性
There's A-A mechanical filtration of water to take out all of that solid Then you've got a process of here, primary sexually.

157
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,680
好的 你有大的容器 你有很多小的固体物质
Okay, so you've got a big tank, you've got quite a lot of small solid material.

158
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,530
不是那种大的塑料和白色的东西 而是小的 固体的材料 你要试着尽早扔掉
This is not your big plastics and whites and that kind of thing, but just small, solid material you want to try and get rid of quite early.

159
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,990
如果你能解决问题 你就能度过一段美好的时光
And you do that by settling, you just basically have a big time.

160
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,160
让所有的固体慢慢变轻 好吗
You allow all of those solids just to slowly set light, OK?

161
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,690
你会看到有旋转它们突然在那里旋转
And you will see that there's a rotating they're suddenly rotating there.

162
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:05,780
水的顶部有东西可以去除掉掉在上面的浮渣 在水箱的顶部 向后移动
And there's something on the top of the water to to take off any scum that falls on top of this, on the top of the tank, and move back.

163
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:15,530
你在瓶子里也有一些东西 把所有些污泥放到底部的某种收集设备里 形状
And then you also have something in this scrape of bottle and put all of this sludge down into into some sort of collection device at the bottom, in shape.

164
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:29,150
现在 基本上你去掉了所有的水 是干净的水 所有的固体都沉淀了 上面的水是相对的 相对的
Now, basically you take off any um water, potentially water that's that's clean, is that all of the solid settling out, and the water on the top is relatively, relatively

165
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,080
就其固体成分而言是干净的
clean in terms of its solid content.

166
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,570
你把它放入所谓的二次治疗中
And then you pop that into something called secondary treatment.

167
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,730
我想要更好的幻灯片
I want to have a better slide, actually.

168
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:56,260
是第二次治疗 第二次治疗的主要目的是减少视频点播 你可以把它写下来
Okay, so you've got your 2nd treatment here, and that involves basically the main purpose of secondary treatment is to reduce the vod Okay, you might want to write that down.

169
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:23,440
是非常重要的 第二回收器的主要观点是 私人处理去除固体 第二处理包括去除生化需氧量 b-o-d和 当你想到b-o-d时 想想可降解有机物 好的 可降解有机物是通过生物过程去除的
That's very important. The main point of 2nd retriever, the private treatments to remove solid Secondary treatment involves removing the biochemical oxygen demand, the B-O-D and the b When you think about B-O-D, think degradable organic matter, OK And the degradable organic matter is removed using a biological process.

170
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:43,340
好吧 当我们谈到他是如何死亡和被降解的在你的链接的海岸上被分解那些藻类的细菌消耗了氧气
Okay? It's when we talked about how he dying and being degraded in off the coast of your links um had been an oxygen being consumed by the bacteria that degrade those algae.

171
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,790
周二 请记住 pur污水处理过程使用的是完全相同的过程
On Tuesday, remember that exactly the same process is used by pur sewage treatment process.

172
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:58,120
我们用细菌来降解废水中的有机物
We're using bacteria to degrade the organic matter in this waste water.

173
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,400
可以通过两种方式实现
And this can be done in two ways.

174
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:30,120
一种方法是 照片在里 基本上是叫做活性污泥erration盆地 那里基本上空气引入槽 与颗粒污泥故意引入到系统的生物膜微生物生长 从而浪费程度的有机物质 对吧
One way is, which is picture here, is basically something called an activated sludge erration basin, where basically air is introduced into this tank, with particles of sludge introduced on purpose into the systems on which grow a biofilm of microorganisms, which can degree the organic matter that's in the waste, okay?

175
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:49,240
我们进入细菌来分解里的有机物 它会进入二级沉淀池 基本上是为了去除任何会溶解的固体
And we get in the the bacteria to degree the organic matter here, and then that will then go into a secondary settling basin to basically to try and remove any solids that there would be dissolved.

176
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,720
有机地图应该被移除
Organic maps should have been removed, or not.

177
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
大部分应该被移除
Most of it should be removed.

178
00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:01,460
你要做的你要把那里的废水处理掉
And then what what you've got to do is you've got to take the waste water from there and and possibly totally treat that.

179
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,080
但是些水可以被排放到自来水中
But that can then be discharged into the service water.

180
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,600
你就会发现他的身体上沾满了污泥
And then you've got a piece of him with a sludge.

181
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,720
整个底部都是污泥的把戏
So all along the bottom here is the sludge trick.

182
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,200
过程中 你要试着把它弄干 因为它非常非常湿
And process, you basically got to try and dry it out, because it's very, very wet.

183
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,220
你可以通过厌氧消化的过程来消化它
And you can digest it in a process called anaerobic digestion.

184
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:37,150
还有全体会议  我们再次利用微生物的过程来降解污泥中的有机物 我们无法摆脱的剩余固体
And to to general meeting. So again, we utilize a microbial process to degrade the organic matter in the sludge, remaining solids that we can't get rid of.

185
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:55,240
在有氧消化过程中 我们会产生计量仪 因为某些类型的细菌是厌氧菌 它们生活在厌氧环境中 它们产生的废物不是二氧化碳 而是一种废物
And in the aerobic digestion, we generate meter, because certain types of bacteria that are anarobes, that that live in an anaerobic environment, instead of generating carbon dioxide of the waste product, they generate meeting as a waste product.

186
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,000
我们能用甲烷做呢
And what can we do with methane?

187
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:09,600
对不起 水公司非常重视能源的使用
Sorry. Okay, so water companies are very alive to the idea of energy use.

188
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,240
好了 回收能源 尽量让他们的生产过程尽的节能
Okay, recycling energy and trying to make their their processes as energy efficient as possible.

189
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:32,630
而污水处理厂是他们努力压榨的领域 试图最大化他们的能源效率 但也产生他们自己的电力 例如
And the sewage treatment works is one area where they try to squeeze, trying to maximize their energy efficiency, but also to generate their own electricity that they can use, e.g.

190
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,130
为周围的公共用水 因为在重的东西周围放水是非常昂贵的 在周围放水也是非常昂贵的
for public water around. Because it's quite expensive to put water around what was heavy, it's very expensive to pop around.

191
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,080
它是昂贵的干燥污泥 例如
It's expensive to dry sludge, e.g.

192
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:52,860
你需要用热来慢慢干燥 如果你可以补贴你在过程中使用的能量 通过产生你自己的能量 是你可以做的一件很整洁的事情
you might have to use heat to dry slow So if you can subsidize the energy that you use in that process by generating your own energy, that's that's kind of a neat thing that that you can do.

193
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:14,840
好的 下一张幻灯片展示了活性污泥处理过程 更详细一些 更多一些 更清晰一些 你们可以看到 从左到右 你们的法律 谁被谴责了 筛选出大的固体 大的固体 小的固体
Okay, the next slide shows the activate sludge treatment process in a bit more detail, a little bit more, with a bit bit clearer And as you can see, from left to right, your laws, who is condemned, screen out the large solids set aloud, the smaller solids.

194
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,660
发电机产生的污泥越多 些污泥就越有降落 或者被消化掉
As much as you can that generator sludge, that sludge can go on to land, or it can be digested.

195
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,440
是刺激罐
Then you've got the irrration tank.

196
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
你把空气引入系统
You introduce air into that system.

197
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,710
你还介绍了一些
You also introduce some

198
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,510
固体进入系统 控制
solids into that system. Control.

199
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:45,120
好的 你在去除孤独 实际上你在里添加了更多的固体 但实际上你只是添加了 你添加了特定的固体已经得到了相关的生物燃料
Okay, so you're removing solitude, you're actually adding more solids here, but the you're actually only adding, you're adding particular solids to have already got an associated biofuel.

200
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:58,110
那些生物燃料中的微生物在那些固体的一侧 它们做的工作是分解所有的分解所有进入盆地的物质
And those microbes in the biofuel on that's on those solid a listless sides, they do the job of breaking down all the up all your getting matter that's coming in enough into that basin.

201
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:10,280
他有了第二个沉淀过程叫做澄清器 在澄清器之后 你可以 你可以排出
And then he got a secondary settling process called a clarifier, and then after the clarifier, you can, you can actually discharge.

202
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:18,960
通常情况下 你可以通过放电来找到左移 或者你需要在末端进行第三次处理 稍后就不讨论了
More often than not, you can actually discharge to find left move, or you might need an a tertiary process on the end and not talk about that later.

203
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,960
好吗 雪橇在里生成 在里生成
OK? Sledges generated here, generated here.

204
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,460
就像我说的 我们摆脱了它 它可以被消化
We got rid of that, as I say, that could be digested often is now.

205
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:53,420
世界公司会尽量从些污泥中榨取能量 从些富含有机物的物质中 尽多地 使用其他的屋顶消化系统 你就会得到厌氧消化产生的废物 基本上被称为污水污泥
So that sludges that the World Company will try to squeeze as much energy out of that, out of that high rich, organic rich material, as possible, using other roof digestion, and then you you're left with a waste product from the anaerobic digestion, which is basically called sewage sludge.

206
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,800
通常适用于土地
And that tends to be applied to land.

207
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,380
好吧 它适用于土地 因为它的营养非常丰富
Okay? And it's applied to land because it's very rich in nutrients.

208
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:07,700
它的铵含量很高 是很好的肥料 对吧
It tends to have very high ammonium content, and it makes a very good fertilizer, okay?

209
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,470
它也有藻类物质 被看作是另外一种物质
And it's also got algalic matter, kind of seen as a sort additionally.

210
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,910
它在农业中很常用
So it's quite commonly used in in agriculture.

211
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,510
张幻灯片展示了次生盆地的情况
This is just a slide to show what goes on in the secondary eration basin.

212
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,820
你可以看到 是很晚的 实际上混合了水
And you can see that there are late that that actually mix the water.

213
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,390
有一根管子用来输送空气
There's A-A pipe through which air is pumped.

214
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:46,820
些气泡进入盆地 混合后给分解有机物的微生物提供氧气
Of that airbasing bubbles of into the basin, mixes it gives oxygen to the microbes that are breaking down the organic matter.

215
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,140
为了确保不是限制因素 些微生物需要氧气
To make sure that that's not a limiting factor, those microbes need oxygen.

216
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,880
还记得藻类退化的例子吗
Remember the the example of algae degrading?

217
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,830
他们使用水中的氧气 并在污水处理过程中降低氧气的含量
They're using oxygen from the water and pulling that down in the sewage treatment process.

218
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:07,490
你要确保种情况不会发生 而且要确保些生物有充足的氧气供应
You want to make sure that that's not going to happen, and that there's always a plentiful supply of oxygen to those, to those organisms.

219
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,690
关于处理器有问题吗
Okay, any questions about that processor?

220
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,020
另一种人的第二疗法第二疗法有两种
The other type of 2nd route human there's two types of 2nd treatment.

221
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,520
是活性污泥处理过程 就像我想描述的
One is the activate sludge treatment process like I want to describe.

222
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,270
第二类二级处理是诱骗过滤器
The 2nd type of secondary treatment is the tricking filter.

223
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,830
而魔术师的电影基本上代替了计划
And the trickmen film to basically just takes the place of the eration plan.

224
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,630
过程和计划中的旅行完全一样 你有你的主定居者
The process is absolutely identical for a trip to Within the plan, you've got your primary settler.

225
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,010
你没时间申辩
You haven't got an arration time.

226
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,410
相反 你有滴滤器 你有最终的澄清器
Instead, you've got trickling filter, and then you have got a final clarifier.

227
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:57,100
你基本上已经得到了你在那里看到的所有东西 除了中间的部分 是是在恶作剧的过滤器里面吗
So you've basically got everything that you see there, except for the the middle bit, is is is there in a tricking filter?

228
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:08,170
过滤器基本上是巨大的圆柱体 里面装满了固体材料 具有非常非常高的表面积
The filter is basically a huge cylinder packed with solid material with a very, very high surface area.

229
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:34,560
在过去 他们使用一种叫做熟料 基本上 我认为 产品的废品冶炼铁矿石和事情 是非常 非常多孔 高表面积 固体材料 只是挤在大床 你随便灌溉床为大武装和清洁工
In the past, they used something called clinker, which was basically, I think, a product of the waste product from smelting iron ore and that kind of thing, which is basically very, very porous, high surface area, solid material, that it just packed into a big bed, and then you literally irrigate the bed into big armed and sweeps round that.

230
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,380
些是水注入手臂的部位
These are arms that the waters pump down into the arms.

231
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,070
你可以在左上方看到澄清的 已经经过一次处理的水
And you can see in the top left there the the clarified, already primary treated water.

232
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,170
在一点上它看起来相当清晰 实际上是均匀地灌溉在海湾上
It looks fairly clear at this point, is literally irrigated onto the bay uniformly.

233
00:29:50,470 --> 00:30:09,020
水通过你所得到的固体物质网络涓涓细流 在此过程中 与固体物质表面相关的微生物分解了废水中的有机物
The water trickle through the network of solid material you've got, and as it does so, microorganisms that are associated with the surfaces of that solid material break down the organic matter that's in that waste water.

234
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:23,550
 我们再次使用相同的想法 把废水与微生物接触 些微生物将分解有机地图 并去除 减少B-F-D
So again, we're using the s the same idea, sort of bringing the waste water into into contact with microorganisms that will break down the organic map and remove, reduce the B-F-D.

235
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,080
是的 除了在种情况下 微生物是在脱扣过滤器填料的表面
Yep. Except in this case, the microorganisms are on the surfaces of the packing of the tripping filter.

236
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,470
现在 实际上 他们经常使用非常小的 高的马戏团区域塑料
These days, actually, they use very small, high circus area plastic, often

237
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,450
而不是熟料 没有最优化的方法
rather than clinker. There's not to optimize that.

238
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,510
 基本上是生物燃料 是生长在些固体表面的细菌
Well, basically it's the biofuel. It's the bacteria that grow on the surfaces of those solids

239
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,070
所有的工作 好吧
that is all the work. Okay?

240
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:57,040
关于战争的争论慢慢地从底部流出来 它有更低的胡须
And the war debate the trickle through out on bottom, and it's got a much lower bearded.

241
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,780
我其实很敏感 是post文件澄清器
I'm actually touchy treatment. So this is post file clarifier.

242
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:31,220
用另一种方法来处理些水还是有用的 通常是因为废水通常含有高浓度的营养物 主要是氮和化石 它是接收水
It may still be useful necessary to treat this water additionally with another process, and that's usually because the waste water often has high concentrations of nutrients, primarily nitrogen and fossil So it might be that the r the receiving water.

243
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:39,890
我们会在后面的模块中讨论很多关于磷的问题 但是浪费的处理厂是磷的主要来源
Will talk a lot about phosphorus later in the in the module, but wasteful treatment plants are big sources of phosphorus.

244
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:47,580
好吧 我们吃的东西中含有大量的磷 我们的废物通常富含磷
Okay? There's a lot of phosphorus in what we eat, so our wastes are often rich in phosphorus.

245
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,230
此外 我们在家庭中使用的很多产品都含有寄养成分
And in addition, we use a lot of products in the household that contain fosterism.

246
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,350
曾几何时 洗衣粉中含有高浓度的磷
Once upon a time, laundry detergents had large high concentrations of phosphorus.

247
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,550
洗碗片仍然含有磷
Dish washing tablets might still contain phosphorus.

248
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,590
我们国内的一些产品含有磷
Some of our other domestic products might contain phosphorus.

249
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:21,770
污水中含有磷 废水处理过程并不能非常有效地去除磷 在液体中会有高浓度的磷
So sewage contains on phosphorus. The wastewater treatment process doesn't really remove phosphorus very efficiently, so there might be skilled quite high concentration of phosphorus in the in the uh affluid.

250
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:33,010
磷 正如我们所知 是一种能刺激藻类生长的营养物质它能在接受水里引发排泄
And phosphorus, as we know, is a nutrit which stimulates algae and could make could trigger dutification in the receiving water.

251
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:39,550
三级处理通常用来去除些营养物质 尤其是磷
So tertiary treatment is often used to remove these nutrients, particularly phosphorus.

252
00:32:39,970 --> 00:33:00,160
只是引入了一种盐 一种化学触发器 就像氯化铁或铝盐板 基本上与水中的磷反应 使其沉淀 设置 水可以以低得多的化石浓度排放
And that might be just introducing a salt, a chemical trigger, like iron chloride or aluminium salt plate that basically react with the phosphorus in the water, makes it precipitate, and that setting that, and then water can be discharged with a much lower fossil concentration.

253
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:11,680
我们称之为磷酸盐 严格来说 另一种对待最后的富人的方式是使用一种叫做抛光池的东西
We call that phosphate. Strictly, another way to treat the The final affluent is something using something called polishing ponds.

254
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,310
我们基本上是在利用湿地来去除养分
We're basically using wetlands to remove the nutrients.

255
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,570
本质上 如果你有空格
So essentially you're pulling if you've got a space.

256
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,950
是弥尔顿·金地区的愤怒
So this angry here from Milton king's area.

257
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:32,060
没有 如果你来自小国王 你的废水被愤怒的水虐待
No Um. If you were from little kings, your wastewater mistreated by angry water.

258
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,140
我把水排放到最后剩下的地方 你们可以在中间看到
And I give water discharge the final left room into these parts you can see in the middle.

259
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:49,440
 它们是相当大的池塘 它们有相当少的树脂时间在夏天 很多植物在那里生长 些植物吸收营养
Um. They're quite big ponds. They've got a reasonably little resins time During the summer, a lot of plants grow in there, and those plants take up the nutrients.

260
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:57,060
是一种拒绝磷酸盐浓度的方法通过把最后的剩下来解决些问题
And so that's one way of refusing phosphate concentration by putting the final left and through these problems.

261
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:03,700
不管怎么说 想法你你去掉了你去掉了营养
And the idea is anyway that you you remove the you remove the nutrients.

262
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,600
那么 当向前的方式被添加到一条河时会发生呢
So what happens when ways forward to is added to a river?

263
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,580
是对富人的治疗 也是对富人治疗的直接指控
So that could be either the treated affluent, or in the case of a direct this charge of of the untreated affluence.

264
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,060
在张图中我们可以看到两种情况
And here we've got both in this picture.

265
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,320
是我在意大利和意大利北部的日子
And this is actually from my days in Italy and northern Italy.

266
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,150
但是米兰以北几公里处的兰德罗河
Um, but this is the river landro quite a few kilometers north of Milan.

267
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:36,110
在张照片的前景中 你可以看到整个水面上的很多东西
And what you see in the foreground of this picture, you can see quite a lot over all the water.

268
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:44,570
好吧 那不应该发生 你不应该在治疗过的人身上看到手机
OK That shouldn't really happen. You shouldn't see phone in a treated escalant.

269
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,350
它得到了很好的处理 好吧 我把手机放在里的原因是 一切都结束了
It's been well treated. Okay? The reason why I've got phone here is that this is actually over.

270
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,550
肯定不是条约的问题 贸易估计实际上下降了
It's not the treaty, definitely. The trade estimate is actually down.

271
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,680
在照片的上方 你可以看到人 是我 实际上站在另管道上
Then right on the top of the picture, you can see someone, which might be me, actually standing on another pipe.

272
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,140
但它实际上是在让擦漆工作的护卫队离开商店 就在右边
But it's actually discharging the escort from the sooge work, which actually out out of shop just to the right.

273
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:18,670
有问题 特别的激增在当时是没有能力的 它不能处理所有白天的流入
Some problem with this, this um particular surge works is it was under capacity at the time, so it couldn't treat all of the daytime inflows.

274
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:25,060
因此 在白天 大量未经处理的废水排放到河流中
And so during the day, large volumes of untreated wastewater discharge into the river.

275
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,100
我们稍后会有关于的例子
And we'll have a case of later about this.

276
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:36,790
我要给你们讲关于我在意大利研究系统的故事
I'll tell you a story about my time in Italy working on this, of this particular system.

277
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,890
无论是治疗还是治疗过程
Whether it's treated or the processes

278
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:49,350
唯一的区别是未经处理的排放 污染物的浓度要高得多
that operate in the river of the same The only difference is with an untreated discharge, the concentrations of much higher of the pollutants.

279
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:56,220
对于未经处理的排放中beard的浓度会远远高于树状排放中的浓度
For the concentration of bear d in the untreated discharge will be much, much higher than the concentrations in the tree of discharge.

280
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,980
污水处理厂通常可以去除95%的B-O-D
So sewage works can typically remove 95% of the B-O-D.

281
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,030
好吧 是 是很多 好吧 我们说的是非常显著的减少
Okay, that's, that's a lot. Okay, so we were talking about a very significant reduction.

282
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,930
与小条约相比 B-O-D是一种治疗努力
B-O-D is a treatment effort compared with a little treaty.

283
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:22,550
想法基本上是V-O-D是一种可降解有机材料的有机混合物
And the idea basically is that the V-O-D is a degradable organic mixture of degrading organic material.

284
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:28,310
是糖交换了1206个蓝色的玻璃 举个例子
Here's a sugar sees exchanged Twelve hundred and six blue panes, just as an example.

285
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:39,240
在水中 微生物利用葡萄糖作为能量来源 并与氧气结合 产生二氧化碳
In the water, microorganisms use that glucose as an energy source, and combined with oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide.

286
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,600
它们会生长 它们会用些物质来生长 但它们肯定会用些物质来维持生命和提供能量
They might grow, they might use some of that material for growth, but they certainly use it for for maintenance and energy.

287
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,320
过程中就排除了二氧化碳和水
So kicked out of this process is carbon dioxide with water.

288
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,600
和光合作用正好相反
It's kind of opposite the photosynthesis.

289
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,340
是呼吸 是呼吸
It's a respir-, it's a respiration.

290
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,430
是呼吸过程 好的 些后合成 你得到二氧化碳和水 它们产生葡萄糖 氧
It's, it's a respiratory process. Okay, those postsynthesis, you get carbon dioxide and water, they make glucose, an oxygen.

291
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,930
在呼吸过程中 情况正好相反
In respiration, you get the opposite.

292
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:17,970
你有了有机物质 用氧气氧化有机分子 如果是有氧过程 你就能排出二氧化碳
You've got the organic material, knee oxygen to oxidize the organic molecule, and you kick out carbon dioxide if you if this is an aerobic process.

293
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,720
微生物的种能力 他们看到了
So the microorbial ability doing this, they see this.

294
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:33,340
水中的任何有机物都将成为微生命的潜在能量来源
Any organic matter in the water will will be a potential energy source for the micro There is reanimation.

295
00:37:34,540 --> 00:38:14,150
谈谈在节课 下下周 因为氧气消耗的微生物是打破现在 所有些有机物在水中 他们使用氧气 但氧气也从空气中进入水 通常是在一条河 是在空气中的传播 特别是如果耗尽氧气 水 扩散到水中的速率实际上更高 随着氧气浓度的降低而增加 我们测量是历史上的
Talk about that later in this lecture, and next next week, because oxygen is consumed as the microorganisms are breaking Now, all of this organic matter in the water, they're using oxygen, but oxygen is also entering the water from the air, usually in a river, so it's diffusing in from the air, particularly if that water has is depleted in oxygen, the diffusion rate into the water is actually higher, increases as the as the concentration of oxygen decreases, we measure the This is kind of historical.

296
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:36,090
我们样做的原因 基本上 不是测量废水或河流中的有机物量 传统上 我们所做的是测量生化需氧量 对吧
Um, the reason why we do it this way, basically, um, rather than measure the amount of organic matter in waste water or in the river, um, traditionally, what has done is a measure is taken of the biochemical oxygen demand, okay?

297
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:43,670
生化需氧量概念来源于测试 真的吗
And the the idea of the bio of biochemic oxygen demand derives from the test, really?

298
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:50,200
好吧 基本上 水中有多少有机物是通过一种叫做BMB的测试来确定的
Okay? So basically, how much organic matters in that water is determined using this test called BMB test.

299
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,300
BV五次测试 好吗 或罪犯5
BV five tests, OK? Or B-D five.

300
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:03,250
它发生在5天内 你要做的是非常缓慢 基本上 你有一些血管
It occurs over five days. What you do is you very slow, no, and you basically, you've got some vessels there.

301
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:36,270
下面里 你把你的垃圾 你的水样本 是河流样本 或废水样品 无论如何 把它放到容器里面 你看到inocular的很小的量 一种细菌innocular 源于是过程 基本上一些细菌降解有机物 看氧气消耗的速率 对吧
Down here, you put your waste, your water sample, could be a river sample, or a wastewater sample, whatever, put it into a vessel, you see it with a very small quantity of an inocular, a bacterial innocular, that could re derive from the suis process, basically some bacteria that you know degrades organic matter, and you look at how much oxygen at the rate at which oxygen is consumed, okay?

302
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:59,770
因为当有机地图被你引入的接种剂降解时 容器中的氧气 会开始减少 因为我们次没有排列 我们只看氧气的消耗 你测量氧气的消耗 是随着时间的推移 些选项的使用频率通常是用来摆脱种系统的
Because as that organic map is degraded by the inocular you introduce, the oxygen in the vessel, will will start to decrease in situation, because we're not arrating this time, so we just looking at the consumption of oxygen, and you measure the consumption of oxygen, this is the rate at which the options used over time to typically use that it kind of occurred to get out of that kind of system.

303
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,280
你在特定的温度下读到些 通常是20度
You read about this at a particular temperature, usually 20 degrees, okay, um.

304
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:14,010
你可以在5天内 测量20度的时间内的选择消耗
And you you measure the option consumption over time over that 20 degrees, at that 20 degrees, over that five days.

305
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,290
好吧 你的死期
Okay? And that that is your B-O-D.

306
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:24,990
B-O-D B-O-D的单位 是a表示每升氧气的毫克数
And the B-O-D, the units for B-O-D, and this is a are in milligrams of oxygen per liter.

307
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,090
我得到了种激活 会在有机内容中得到真正的乐趣
I get with this activation, will get really pleasure in organic content.

308
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:34,930
但是在降解有机物的过程中消耗的是氧气
But it's the oxygen that is consumed in degrading that organic matter.

309
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,490
好吧 对我来说 古巴的剂量是一样的
Okay, the grounds for me, the Cuba have got there is the same milligram.

310
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,910
好了 我们现在看到的是
Okay, so we're actually looking at at,

311
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,910
基本上 在5天或23天的时间里 我们消耗了多少氧气
um, uh, basically, how, how, how much oxygen is consumed over five day period, or 23

312
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,550
在顶部A 你有一些东西
at the top A, you've got something

313
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,080
叫ninetification 大家都知道是吗
called ninetification. Everybody know what that is?

314
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,190
你还记得
You remember

315
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,100
从开始 第一年和第二年生物地球化学循环
from the off, 1st and 2nd year biogeochemical cycles.

316
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,680
有人想猜一下耐克的产品吗
Anybody like to guess doing something Nike?

317
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,960
是吗 那么是呢
Is it? So what might be?

318
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,420
让我转换吗 还记得是吗
Make me converted? Remember what it is?

319
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:33,090
13 硝酸钠各种修改 炒了 炒了
Nitrate all kind of revise, fired, fire.

320
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,970
就忘了 你在为考试复习就忘了它了
And forget, you sort of revise for the exam and then and forget about it.

321
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:48,210
基本上 是过程 铵被转化成我尝试过的第一种 变成不评级
Basically, it's a process whereby ammonium is converted into 1st of all that I tried, and then into not rating.

322
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,580
随着过程的进行 你可以看到氧气被添加到最后
And as this process proceed, you can see that actually oxygen has been added to the end.

323
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,860
每一次 你都有两个选项加到最后
Okay, so each time, so you got two options added to the end.

324
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,980
你有3头多出来的牛
You got three of the the an extra ox to the end there.

325
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,740
是过程 夜化过程是氧化的过程
This is a process, the nightification process is a process of oxidation.

326
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:20,830
emoium被那些特殊物质氧化成硝酸盐那需要氧气
The emoium is oxidized to nitrate by those specials my And that uses oxygen.

327
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,750
你需要 你需要从某处得到些氧气 些氧气来自水
You need to, you need to get this oxygen from somewhere, and that that's coming from the water.

328
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:36,190
除了在有机化合物的降解过程中消耗氧气外 我们也在通知过程中消耗了一些氧气
So as well as oxygen being consumed in the degradation of organic compounds, we've also got some oxygen being consumed in notification.

329
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,180
基本上是发生的 通常是在五天之后
And that's basically occurring, usually after the five day period.

330
00:42:42,520 --> 00:43:16,800
但通常 如果你做A-B-O-D测试 你会添加一些东西来抑制形成反应的微生物 硝化剂 和烘烤 你基本上不会混淆在分解你的袋子物质时消耗的氧气 你消耗氧气的通知率通常会提高温度
But often, if you do it A-B-O-D test, you will add something that inhibits the microbes that form this reaction, the nitrofiers, and bake, so you basically don't get any confusion between the oxygen consume in in degrading your bag matter, and the option you consuming notification rate at which oxygen is utilized will be will generally increase the temperature.

331
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:29,370
大多数化学反应随着温度的升高而增加 但大多数微生物介导的反应也随着温度的升高而增加
So most chemical reactions increase with temperature, but also most microbially mediated reactions also increase with temperature.

332
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,960
张幻灯片展示的是 瓶子中氧气的利用率取决于温度
So this slide is just showing, but the rate at which the oxygen is utilized in a bottle will depend on the temperature.

333
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:44,290
如果温度达到5度 那么在5天内氧气消耗就会减少
If you have that five degrees than less oxygen will be consumed in a five day period.

334
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,970
如果温度是25度 就会消耗更多的氧气
If you have at a 25 degrees and more oxygen will be consumed.

335
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,380
通常测试的标准温度是20度
And usually the uh, the test is set at a standard temperature of 20 degrees.

336
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,960
你把它放在能保持20度温度的培养箱里
You put it in an incubator that is able to maintain the temperature 20 degrees.

337
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:22,840
河流中真正发生的是有机物 APAB和D 在河流中被微生物降解通常出现在河床的表面 在河床的背面 那里是河流中大部分生物燃料的地方 而不是水柱
What's actually going on in the river is that organic matter, APA B of D, is degraded in the river by the microbes present in the often on the surfaces of the bed, in the backs, that's where most of the biofuel in the river, not in the water column.

338
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:29,120
是我们的河的横截面是我们的水面
So here's our, here's our river cross section is our our water surface.

339
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:40,960
在水柱中 你会有自由悬浮的微生物菌落生活在水柱中
Within the water column, you will have free suspended colonies of microbes that live in the water column.

340
00:44:41,120 --> 00:45:05,760
你会有一些微生物生活在悬浮颗粒上 在水柱中悬浮 但大多数能够很好地氧化B-D的微生物实际上会在床的表面 在河岸上 那些生活在河底的沉积物
And you'll have some microbes that live on suspended particle, suspended solitude in the water columns, but most of the organisms that can actually do a good job in terms of oxidizing B-D is actually, are actually going to be on the surfaces of the bed, in the banks, the the sediment that lives the the the sediment that that that is at the bottom of the of the river.

341
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:15,220
好吧 微生物就在那里 它们利用水柱中的氧气来完成降解过程
Okay? That's where microbes are. And they use oxygen in the water column to perform the degradation process.

342
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:24,630
在过程中 它们消耗氧气 但排出二氧化碳 氧气会与大气交换
And in in that process, they they consume oxygen, but they kick out carbon dioxide, an oxygen will be exchanged with the atmosphere.

343
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:43,050
如果他们消耗氧气 更多的氧气将由飞行员提供 通过空气 从大气中扩散到受影响的身体
So if they degree, if they consume oxygen, more oxygen will be the um will be supplied by the pilot, by the air, and diffuse into the influenced body from from the atmosphere.

344
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:43,510
率
The rate

345
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,270
与我们所说的氧气不足成正比
at which that happens is proportional to what we call the oxygen deficit,

346
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:55,510
发生在交易上的旧教条
which this is what's happening in terms of deal this old doctrine.

347
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,310
是我们的下午 好吗 结果是 在努力之后 得到很大的
So here's our afternoon, okay? And what happens is, just after the effort, get a big

348
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,290
增加骨密度 蓝色实线是B-D
increase in BMD. That the blue solid line there is is B-D.

349
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,450
是美丽 浓度上升
It's a beauty. Concentration goes up.

350
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:18,360
随着些微生物的喷射 所有的有机物 B-O-D浓度 下降了 因为微生物利用或没有减少能量
And then as those microbes sprayed, all of that organic matter, the B-O-D concentration, comes down because the microbes are utilizing or not reduce, the energy.

351
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,710
在过程中 它们把氧气从边界柱中移走
And in the process, they they move oxygen from the border column.

352
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,110
氧是通过表面扩散而加入的
Oxygen is being added by diffusion from the surface.

353
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:41,950
在一点上 氧气通过扩散进入系统的速率显然超过了微生物和选择浓度开始恢复的速率
At this point, the rate at which oxygen is entering the system by diffusion exceeds the rate of which, obviously consume either microbial and the option concentration, start to recover.

354
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,880
就像我周二说的 叫做氧气袋
And as I said on Tuesday, this is called the oxygen sack.

355
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:57,640
氧气扩散到水体中的速率与我们所说的饱和桌成正比
The rate at which oxygen diffuses into the water body is proportional to what we call something called the the saturation desk.

356
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,060
好吗 试着在张幻灯片上解释一下 我想在我解释完篇文章后我会结束
OK? And try and explain this to this slide, and I think I'm gonna finish after I've explained this this post.

357
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:20,460
红线表示容器中溶解氧的浓度是热力学平衡 对吧
The red line basically shows the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a vessel Art thermodynamic equilibrium, OK?

358
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:37,810
可育马驹的基本意思是一种动态的 稳定的状态 在种状态下 氧气从水中扩散出来 等于氧气因为卵而扩散到水中
The fertile equipine basically means a condition of dynamic, steady state, in which the diffusion of oxygen out of the water is equal to the diffusion of oxygen into the water because of egg.

359
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,870
是进入水分子和离开水分子之间的平衡
Those are balance between how many water molecules are actually entering, how many are leaving.

360
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,990
离捕获系统还有几个月的时间
It's a bit like a few months from catching systems.

361
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:52,230
去年我讲了VAPO蒸发 用种方法使压力饱和
Last year I talked about a VAPO evaporation and saturate a very pressure in this way.

362
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,460
好 想象一下 我的意思是 瓶子 作为例子
Okay, so imagine use, I mean, bottle, as an example.

363
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:02,640
假设我们有瓶子 瓶子里含有溶解在水中的一些氧气
Imagine we have this bottle. This bottle contains some oxygen dissolved in the water.

364
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,000
好吗 当然 你有头部空间里面有21%的氧气 对吧
OK? And of course, you've got a head space which has got 21% oxygen in it, OK?

365
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,990
头部空间中有很多氧分子 对吧
There's lots of oxygen molecule in the head space, OK?

366
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:20,050
氧分子之间会有动态的交换它是在顶空中 和溶解在水中的小分子之间
And there will be a dynamic exchange between oxygen molecules it was in a headspace, and noshy molecules in the dissolved in the water.

367
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:36,510
好吧 如果你把它放在特定的温度下 是的 它最终会达到一种叫做热力学平衡的状态 在种状态下 你知道 基本上没有观察系统的净输入
Okay? And if you leave this in particular temperature, yeah, that eventually reaches something called theodynamic equilibrium, in which the favorite palace, you know, basically there's no net input of watching into the system.

368
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,390
不管系统里还有选项 好吗
And no matter what option it leaves in system, OK?

369
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:49,020
但是如果我把Onto从水中移开 那么物理学就会重新建立起来
But if I remove Onto from the water, OK, then the physics wants to kind of re establish, literally.

370
00:48:49,280 --> 00:49:05,000
在一点上 如果我把氧气从水中移走 我们就会降低水中的浓度 让它爆炸 降低活力在livium水平 也我们所说的饱和水平 氧气会倾向于从另地方扩散进来
So at that point, if I remove oxygen from the water, then we reduce the concentration in the water to blow up, lower dynamic at the livium level, which we call the saturation level, and oxygen will will tend to diffuse in from the other.

371
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:15,060
一旦你取任何温度的氧气浓度低于条线 就会有氧气再次扩散到水中
As soon as you take the oxygen concentration of any temperature below that line, there will be a next diffusion of oxygen into water.

372
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,380
好吧 如果你越界了 他们就不会么做了
Okay? If you're out the line, they won't that.

373
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,820
在温度下的浓度 假设是10度 在桥上已经很冷了 对吧
That the concentration at this temperature, which let's say is ten degrees, it's quite cold you've got in the bridge, OK?

374
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:31,950
在10度的时候 会有 比如说 2毫克的氧气 完全可以忽略水
So at ten degrees, there will be, say, at that, .2 milligrams of oxygen, totally to ignore water.

375
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,850
好吧 样了
Okay, that's, that's what it'll be.

376
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:42,280
但是如果你去除氧气 比如说 如果你添加一些细菌 它们会利用选项 它们会降低选项浓度
But if you remove the oxygen, say, if you add some bacteria and there that are utilizing that option, then they would reduce the option concentration.

377
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:49,670
如果我们把它留在那里 选项基本上会扩散进来 因为会有所谓的赤字 对吧
Then if we just left it there, an option would basically diffuse in for that, because there'd be a so called deficit, okay?

378
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:57,850
亏缺的大小很重要因为从空气到水的扩散速率 与亏缺成正比
And the size of that deficit is important because the rate of diffusion from the air, into the into the water, is proportional to that deficit.

379
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:08,880
如果亏空很大 如果浓度很低 假设是5 那么亏空就很大 水在水火中扩散的速度也很大
If the deficit is big, so if the concentration is really low, let's say it's five, that leads to the deficit is big, and the rate at which the water will diffuse in water fire.

380
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:20,880
好的 你可以看到 在果园里 在南边的曲线上 我们得到的不是浓度 在左边 我们得到的是饱和度
Okay, so you can see, based in the orchard, in the south curve, again, we've got, instead of concentration, on the left, we've got percent of saturation.

381
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,400
赤字你离饱和水平有多远
The deficit is basically how far you are away from that that saturation level.

382
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,940
在氧侧曲线中 有最大的缺氧量
In the oxygen side curve, you have the maximum deficit.

383
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:47,460
在氧气浓度最低的地方 在一点上氧气扩散到水中是最高的因为开始超过了氧气被微生物利用的情况
And where the oxygen concentration is lowest, and at that point the oxygen diffusion ran into the water is quite is highest because and and starts to exceed the raid in which oxygen is being utilized by the microbes.

384
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:53,470
两个区域被称为保留区退化
And this is these two zones are called reserve degravation.

385
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:54,750
和
And

386
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:08,960
不了 但偶尔人们还是会称过程为自然净化过程 因为
not anymore. But occasionally people still refer to this process as the natural purification process, because

387
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,250
实际上你所做的是通过过程净化你从骨密度中移除的水
really what you're doing is you are a kind of purifying the water you remove in the BMD via this process.

388
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:24,990
事情样发生的 人们等着进来
And and this is how it all happens, it's people waiting to come in.

389
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:32,650
今天就讲到里 下周二再讲
So I'm going to finish now, and I will pick up this on Tuesday.

390
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:42,220
我不会要求你们看节课来选择你们以及我下周二要讲的内容的价值
Not going to ask you to look at the lecture to choose you and on any value about what I want to do for next Tuesday.

391
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,460
基本上下周二的课程是标准的 就在里
So basically the next Tuesday will be a standard lecture, right here.

392
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,190
有人有问题吗 的
Anybody who got any questions? The.
